<h1>How has Ainomo's technology changed Blockchain?</h1>
<p>In the era of digital transformation, blockchain technology is key to ensuring the security, transparency and efficiency of various processes. At Ainomo, we are committed to utilising the most advanced blockchain solutions to create innovative products and services. In this article, we will detail the blockchain technologies we use and how they help us stay at the forefront of technological advancements.</p>
<p>The key technologies are consensus algorithms, smart contracts and decentralised applications (DApps). Each of these technologies contributes to improving the performance and security of the company's solutions, making them more attractive to businesses and developers.</p>
<p>The main consensus algorithms used in Ainomo:</br>
Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW): These are the two main consensus algorithms we use at Ainomo to ensure the security and efficiency of our blockchain network.</p>
<p>- Proof of Work (PoW): This algorithm requires network participants to perform complex computations to validate transactions and create new blocks. PoW provides a high level of security due to the complexity of the computational tasks, which makes attacks on the network extremely difficult and costly. However, PoW requires significant energy consumption, which can be a disadvantage from a sustainability perspective.</p>
<p>- Proof of Stake (PoS): Unlike PoW, PoS is based on the number of tokens that participants in the network own. The more tokens a participant has, the more likely they are to validate the transaction and create a new block. This algorithm is more energy efficient as it does not require performing complex calculations. PoS also encourages long-term token ownership and participation in the development of the network, which contributes to its sustainability and security.</p>
<p><i>The use of both algorithms allows Ainomo to balance security and energy efficiency, selecting the optimal solutions for different applications and operating conditions.</i></p>
<p>Equally important and one of the basic things in the structure of Ainomo is the Smart Contract.</p>
<p>We are actively developing and implementing smart contracts for various tasks, from automating payments to managing chains of trading activity in financial markets. These contracts are recorded on blockchain and automatically executed when certain conditions occur, making them impossible to modify or counterfeit.
Smart contracts play an important role in automating business processes, reducing the time and resources required to execute them. This is especially important in financial transactions where accuracy and speed of execution are critical.</p>
