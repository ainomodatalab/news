<h1>AI and oracles in smart contracts: creating robust decentralized solutions for external data
</h1>
<p>Smart contracts are one of the most significant innovations in the world of blockchain technology. However, they only work with data that exists within the blockchain, which limits their application in real-world tasks. To interact with external data sources, oracles have been created - mechanisms that provide smart contracts with outside information, allowing them to function in the context of the real world. Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to play a special role in this process, which can significantly improve the reliability and efficiency of oracles.
</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence can significantly improve the reliability and quality of the data coming through oracles. AI is capable of analyzing huge amounts of data, detecting anomalies, eliminating erroneous or false data, and automatically adapting to changing conditions.

<ul>
<li>Analyzing and filtering data</br>One of the main tasks of AI in oracles is to filter and analyze data to improve its reliability. AI can use machine learning to identify patterns and outliers in the data, which helps prevent errors due to untrue or inaccurate data. For example, if multiple data sources provide conflicting information, AI algorithms can determine which ones are more reliable based on historical data and current conditions.
</li>
<li>Decentralized Decision Making</br>AI can also help decentralize decision making. AI can aggregate data from many different sources, automatically ranking them based on trustworthiness and quality. This approach makes the system invulnerable to manipulation as decisions are made based on multiple decentralized sources.
</li>
<li>Forecasting and adapting to changing conditions</br>AI can also be useful for predicting and adapting to changes in the market or data, which is especially important for smart contracts involving highly volatile assets. AI algorithms can predict changes in advance based on historical data and current market conditions, ensuring more accurate contract execution.
</li>
<li>Automate complex scenarios</br>Complex smart contracts that involve multiple conditions and dependencies can be automated with AI to simplify processes. AI can manage smart contracts for predictive execution of financial transactions, servicing derivatives using external data such as market indices and macroeconomic indicators.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The integration of AI and oracles into smart contracts opens up new opportunities for decentralized solutions, enabling reliable data transfer and process automation.</p>
