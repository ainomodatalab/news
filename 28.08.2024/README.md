<h1>Liquidity pools: Why are they needed and how do investors get returns?</h1>
<p>Liquidity pools have become an important element in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. They provide liquidity for various financial transactions and allow investors to generate passive income. One of the main objectives of liquidity pools is to provide sufficient assets for trading operations.</p>
<p>In Ainomo, AI uses pools managed by smart contracts that allow users to exchange tokens directly with the pool. Thanks to liquidity pools, we can further provide liquidity, reduce trading spreads when necessary, increase clustered positions, which makes trading more profitable and efficient.</p>
<p>Another important function of pools is to ensure the smooth operation of financial products. Liquidity pools play a key role in the DeFi ecosystem by providing the necessary resources to run various financial products such as lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and staking protocols.</p>
<p>We provide returns on multiple positions for our investors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commissions for transactions using the liquidity pool charge a small fee. These commissions are distributed to all liquidity providers in proportion to their contribution to the pool. This creates a constant stream of income for investors.</li>
<li>Rewards for providing liquidity to DeFi applications and other products of the company and its partners. This incentivizes investors to contribute funds to the pools.</li>
</ul>
<p>LP-token revenue. LP-tokens can be used in other DeFi applications to generate additional income, for example through steaking.</p>
<p>Advantages of using Ainomo liquidity pools for corporate and private clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passive income: Investors can earn passive income by providing liquidity and receiving transaction fees.</li>
<li>Diversification: Investing in different liquidity pools can diversify risk and increase potential returns.</li>
<li>Incentives and rewards: Additional rewards in the form of tokens increase total returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Liquidity pools are a powerful tool in the world of decentralized finance, providing users with the opportunity to earn passive income and provide liquidity in the market. Understanding their operation and risks allows investors to use this tool effectively and maximize the benefits of their investments.</p>
