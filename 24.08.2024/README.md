<h1>Bitcoin price taps $64K</h1>
<p>Bitcoin bulls charge into key BTC price resistance as the US Federal Reserve gives a clear signal regarding interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>Bitcoin spiked through $64,000 after the Aug. 23 Wall Street open as the United States Federal Reserve announced the first interest rate cuts since 2019.
Investors reacted warmly to confirmation by Fed Chair Jerome Powell that interest rates were now due to fall.</p>
<p>“The time has come for policy to adjust”, he said during a speech at the annual Jackson Hole symposium.</p>
<p>The latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, meanwhile, saw markets betting on a 0.25% rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting at the end of September.</p>
<p>“Bitcoin is still facing a crucial breakout. If it breaks through $62K, that would be a sign for the markets to continue rallying this week”, 
Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm MNTrading, confirmed in his latest X analysis.</p>
<p>Van de Poppe added that the influx of capital to the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the past week meant such a scenario was “likely.”</p>
<p>“We'll likely have that breakout, given the massive inflow we've seen in the ETF the past week”, he wrote.</p>
