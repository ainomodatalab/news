<h1>Layer 1 Blockchain Ainomo: Innovative Platform for the Future</h1>
<p>In the era of digital transformation, blockchain technology plays an important role in ensuring the security, transparency and efficiency of various processes. At Ainomo, we are proud to have developed our own Layer 1 blockchain, which will be the basis for many innovative solutions, and we are working on improving it every day.
</p>
<p>What is a layer 1 blockchain?
</p>
<p>Layer 1 (L1) blockchain is the underlying infrastructure on which other technologies and applications are built. Unlike Layer 2 (L2) solutions, which run on top of existing blockchain networks to improve scalability and speed, the Layer 1 blockchain provides the fundamental foundation for all operations and processes.
</p>
<p>Our Blockchain, has high transaction speeds and has the additional ability to scale the platform to accommodate the need to process high transaction volume per second (TPS) to ensure high throughput and minimal latency. For example, currently 15 confirmations on Ainomo's blockachain is 0.03 seconds.
</p>
<p>Ainomo's Layer 1 Blockchain is capable of scaling as the network grows and the number of users increases. This is achieved through the use of advanced consensus algorithms and sharding technologies. We utilize state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques to ensure data and transaction security. This includes protection against attacks, data encryption and the use of smart contracts.
</p>
<p>Blockchain Ainomo has a high level of decentralization, which ensures the stability of the network and completely eliminates the risks of centralized management. In addition, our platform is highly interoperable and supports interoperability with other blockchain networks and enables the integration of various applications and services.
</p>
<p>We have implemented sharding technologies to improve the scalability of our network. Sharding allows us to divide the blockchain into several parallel segments (shards), which significantly increases throughput and speeds up transaction processing.
</p>
<p>To ensure the security and robustness of transactions, we use advanced encryption methods such as zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge). These methods allow us to authenticate data without revealing its contents.
</p>
<p>Ainomo's L1 blockchain provides high speed and security of transactions, as well as minimal commissions, which gives an undoubted advantage for network users. Also, high standards of security and data encryption guarantee reliability and transparency of all transactions for customers.
</p>
<p>For developers, our platform provides convenient tools for developing decentralized applications (DApps). Support for smart contracts and interoperability with other networks allows you to create innovative solutions for various industries.
</p>
<p>It is possible to build secure and transparent financial applications on our Blockchain, including payment systems, lending platforms and decentralized exchanges.
</p>
<p>Ainomo's Layer 1 blockchain is an innovative platform that provides high speed, security and scalability for a variety of applications and services. We are proud of our achievements and continue to work on improving our technology to provide our users and developers with the most advanced solutions on the market.
