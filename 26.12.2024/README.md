<h1>Artificial intelligence and security in the crypto network: the future from Ainomo
</h1>
<p>In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, security has become a critical aspect for all participants, from large financial institutions to individual investors. At Ainomo, we are convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) plays a key role in protecting and strengthening cryptocurrency networks. 
</p>
<p>The role of AI in crypto-network defense
</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence has already become a powerful tool in the fight against cyber threats. Let's take a look at the main areas of application of AI to improve security:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Threat analysis and prediction</br>
AI algorithms are capable of analyzing huge data sets in real time, identifying suspicious activity. For example, anomalous transactions or unusual behavior patterns can be detected before a breach occurs.
</li>
<li>Detecting phishing attacks</br>
Machine learning allows AI to recognize fake websites, emails and messages, reducing the likelihood of a successful phishing attack. This is especially important for protecting users of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges.
</li>
<li>Protecting smart contracts</br>Automated source code analysis of smart contracts using AI enables AI to find potential vulnerabilities before they are deployed. This reduces exploit risks and minimizes losses.
</li>
<li>Combat fraudulent transactions</br>
Neural networks trained on data from past frauds can accurately identify potentially dangerous transactions and block them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology solutions from Ainomo
</p>
<p>At Ainomo, we develop and deploy innovative AI-based solutions to secure crypto networks:
