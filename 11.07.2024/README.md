<h1><b>A new era of AI thanks to Blockchain integration</b></h1>
<p><i>In today's world, digital transformation is becoming the foundation of progress, and we at Ainomo are proud to play a key role in this process. Our company is one of the leading developers in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies. We strive not just to keep up with technology trends, but to create them, shaping the future together with our partners and customers.</i></p>
<p>Since 2018, we have been developing AI solutions that help automate processes, improve the quality of decision-making, and increase productivity. Our technologies are actively applied in such areas as BigData, financial acquiring, and financial management based on machine learning. We combine different learning methods, which gives us the ability to process data as efficiently as possible and in real time. This model allows us to adapt computational algorithms to market conditions and obtain efficient results that were not available before.</p>
<p><i>So what is the main advantage of integrating AI and Blockchain?</i></p>
<p>One of the main benefits of integrating AI into blockchain is improved data security. We use our own L1 blokchain system, which provides secure storage and distribution of data in a decentralised method, which is especially important for AI systems that handle large volumes of sensitive information.</p>
<p>At Ainomo, we have built a system where all participants can trust AI results and algorithms. Our blockchain solutions help companies automate transactions and ensure a high level of data security.</p>
<p>The core technologies that we use to integrate AI into Blockchain:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The foundation</b> of many of our AI solutions is Machine learning. We use advanced algorithms to train models on large amounts of data. Our models are able to analyse and interpret complex data, enabling them to make decisions with high accuracy.</li>
<li><b>The second</b> equally important approach is Supervised Learning. In this approach we use labelled data to train models. For example, to create a system for diagnosing clustered liquidity volumes in the currency markets, we use the most accurate historical reports possible, especially important are statistics on hourly timeframes such as: 1H,1D,4D,1M, which allows the model to recognise patterns and better analyse the current trend, adaptability and conjuncture of financial markets.</li>
<li>For spatial behaviour and better adaptability in human interaction, we use Unsupervised Learning.  Ainomo models are trained on unsupervised data. This approach is used to analyse large amounts of data and discover hidden patterns and relationships, e.g. to analyse user behaviour and improve service personalisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>And one of the most fundamental and basic approaches is Deep Learning. We at Ainomo actively use this method to develop complex AI solutions. Neural networks based on multiple layers allow models to learn and process information similarly to the human brain. This principle allows us to build trading robots as efficiently as possible, which in their actions copy the behaviour of ordinary traders as closely as possible, but at the same time have incomparably greater potential for analysis and speed of data processing and reproduction. This is very important at trading sessions where it is necessary to keep volatility in a certain range.</p>
<p>Ainomo is at the forefront of developing and training complex neural networks for a variety of tasks. For example, convolutional neural networks are used for image processing and object recognition, which is important for medical diagnostics and autonomous systems.
Our AI analyses vast amounts of data on market trends and financial performance to create more accurate and efficient trading strategies. Blockchain provides reliability and transparency to the data used by the AI, which increases the accuracy of predictions and reduces risk. This is particularly useful for traders and investors in cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets.</p>
<p><i>The integration of AI into Blockchain opens up new opportunities for decentralised financial systems (DeFi). We at Ainomo use DeFi to provide financial services without intermediaries. The powerful AI model allows us to automate lending, investment and asset management processes, making them more accessible and efficient.</i></p>
